# Lab3_HTML5

This folder contains three tasks focusing on HTML5 and CSS. Each task involves creating a different web component and applying various HTML and CSS techniques.

## Task 1

Task 1 involves creating a simple form to change an email address. The HTML structure consists of a form element containing input fields for name and email, along with associated span elements to display error messages. CSS styles the form elements, providing visual feedback for valid and invalid inputs.

## Task 2

Task 2 involves creating a button with a hover effect that makes it blink. The HTML consists of a simple button element. CSS styles the button with a border, background color, and box-shadow, and defines a keyframe animation for the hover effect.

## Task 3

Task 3 involves creating a decorative design using HTML and CSS. The HTML contains a div element with multiple p elements inside to represent text and shapes such as a heart and a triangle. CSS styles the elements to position them correctly and applies transformations to rotate the heart shape.
